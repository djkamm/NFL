# NFL Play Type Prediction Model

The purpose of this model is to predict the NFL play type under specific conditions and given specific rules and definitions detailed below.  There are 2 separate Play Prediction Models:
* Basic Play Type (Run or Pass)
* Detail Play Type (Run with run gap or Pass with pass depth)

Examples of specific conditions required for accurate model predictions include but are not limited to:

* Prediction model does not apply in 4th down situations.  Applicable on 1st through 3rd down only.  
* Prediction model does not apply to last 2 minutes of half or overtime situations
* Prediction model does not apply when the QB fumbles the ball during the play, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the play.  These plays are considered aborted.

Examples of Specific Rules:

* Sacks are classified as Pass Plays
* Plays that result in an accepted penalty are non-plays and do not count either as a pass play or a run play.

These are the most primary / obvious rules and limitations.  There are additional details and rules of use pointed out in rhe detail below.

### Import Data

To import data.  This data is available from Kaggle at [link] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
```{r import rawData, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#Remove Directory in final document
rawData <- read_csv("C:/Users/David Kamm/My Documents/Data Science Projects/NFL Play by Play/NFL Play by Play 2009-2017 (v4).csv")
```

### Basic Data Reduction

In this section, we will apply basic record filtering.  The final prediction model is not intended to predict Play Type on 4th Down.  Nor is it intended to predict Play Type in the last 2 minutes of either half or overtime. In addition, 'miscellaneous' plays (field goal, punt, kickoff, extra point, etc) are also removed from the data set and prediction model.
```{r Basic Record Filtering, cache = TRUE, dependson = "rawData"}
relevantData <- rawData[rawData$down %in% c(1,2,3),]
relevantData <- relevantData[relevantData$TimeSecs > 1920 | relevantData$TimeSecs <= 1800 & relevantData$qtr !=2, ]
relevantData <- relevantData[relevantData$TimeSecs > 120,]
relevantData <- relevantData[relevantData$PlayType %in% c('Pass', 'Run', 'Sack'),]
```


The raw data contains 4 fields that are obviously not necessary for pre-processing and are also not of use in modeling.  These fields will be removed.
```{r Basic Field Reduction, cache = TRUE, dependson = "relevantData"}
colImportance <- names(relevantData)
colImportance <- as.data.frame(colImportance)
colImportance$keep = 1
colImportance[c(6, 14, 20, 81:101),]$keep = 0
keep <- colImportance$keep
keep <- as.logical(keep)
relevantData <- relevantData[,keep]

```

### Reclassing Data and Additional Filtering

Detail explanations provided in code comments
```{r Reclass Data and Additional Filtering, cache = TRUE, dependson = "relevantData"}

##Reclass any plays originally classified as 'Sack' to 'Pass'
relevantData[relevantData$PlayType == 'Sack',]$PlayType = 'Pass'

##Reclass Pass Length to 'Sack Impute' when field 'Sack' = 1.  This is for the purpose of identifying records necessary to impute.
relevantData[relevantData$Sack == 1 & is.na(relevantData$PassLength), ]$PassLength = 'Impute'

##When play description contains 'middle', reclass field 'RunGap' to 'middle'
relevantData[is.na(relevantData$RunGap) & str_detect(relevantData$desc, 'middle') == 1, ]$RunGap = 'middle'

##Reclass Pass Length to 'Impute' when empty.  This is for the purpose of identifying records necessary to impute.
relevantData[relevantData$PlayType == 'Pass' & is.na(relevantData$PassLength), ]$PassLength = 'Impute'

##Remove aborted plays (plays are classified as aborted if the Quarterback fumbles the ball, irrespective of what team or player recovers the ball).  These plays are also exempt from prediction model usage.
flag <- relevantData$PlayType == 'Run' & is.na(relevantData$RunGap) & str_detect(relevantData$desc, 'Aborted')
flag <- !flag
relevantData <- relevantData[flag,]

##When play description contains 'guard' and field 'RunGap' is empty, reclass field 'RunGap' to 'guard'
relevantData[relevantData$PlayType == 'Run' & is.na(relevantData$RunGap) & str_detect(relevantData$desc, 'guard') == 1, ]$RunGap = 'guard'

##When play description contains 'tackle' and field 'RunGap' is empty, reclass field 'RunGap' to 'tackle'
relevantData[relevantData$PlayType == 'Run' & is.na(relevantData$RunGap) & str_detect(relevantData$desc, 'tackle') == 1, ]$RunGap = 'tackle'

##When play description contains 'end' and field 'RunGap' is empty, reclass field 'RunGap' to 'end'
relevantData[relevantData$PlayType == 'Run' & is.na(relevantData$RunGap) & str_detect(relevantData$desc, 'end') == 1, ]$RunGap = 'end'

##Remove 'Play Under Review' records, as these are not actual plays.
flag <- relevantData$PlayType == 'Run' & is.na(relevantData$RunGap) & str_detect(relevantData$desc, 'play under review')
flag <- !flag
relevantData <- relevantData[flag,]

##Remove 16 miscellaneous records where play description revealed record was not an actual play
relevantData <- relevantData[-c(5502, 26625, 29631, 51927, 68727, 71259, 72879, 84467, 96879, 115280, 195025, 204505, 205358, 212650, 225194, 227938),]

##Reclass is.na(RunGap) to 'Impute' when PlayType = 'Run' & is.na(RunGap)
##Reclass RunGap to 'Impute' when empty.  This is for the purpose of identifying records necessary to impute.
relevantData[relevantData$PlayType == 'Run' & is.na(relevantData$RunGap), ]$RunGap = 'Impute'

##Reclass RunGap to NA for Pass Plays
relevantData[relevantData$PlayType == 'Pass' & !is.na(relevantData$RunGap),]$RunGap = NA
```

### Import and Merge Additional Attributes

Additional play attributes were generated offline.  These attributes have potential value in predicting play calls, but were not included in the Kaggle dataset.  These additional attributes include:
* Week of Season
* Count of Season to Date Wins for Home Team
* Difference in Win Count between Home and Visiting Teams
* Flag indicating Divisional Game

***Excel file for import is contained separately***
```{r Import and Merge Additional Attributes, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, dependson = "relevantData", eval = TRUE}
ScheduleStats <- read_csv("C:/Users/David Kamm/My Documents/Data Science Projects/NFL Play by Play/ScheduleStats.csv")
relevantData <- merge(relevantData, ScheduleStats)
```

### Keep only fields necessary for remaining pre-processing and pertinent to modeling

Remove all fields redundant to additional pre-processing activities and that are obviously not pertinent to modeling
```{r Remove all remainign unnecessary fields,  cache = TRUE, dependson = "relevantData"}
keptColumns <- c('Drive', 'down', 'TimeSecs', 'yrdline100', 'ydstogo', 'posteam', 'DefensiveTeam', 'PlayType', 'PassLength', 'AirYards', 'QBHit', 'RunGap', 'Sack', 'PosTeamScore', 'ScoreDiff', 'HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam', 'posteam_timeouts_pre', 'Season', 'Week', 'HomeTeamGamesWon', 'HomeVsAwayGamesWon', 'DivisionGame')
ImpCol <- as.data.frame(colnames(relevantData))
ImpCol$keep = 0
row.names(ImpCol) = ImpCol$`colnames(relevantData)`
ImpCol[row.names(ImpCol) %in% keptColumns,]$keep = 1
keep <- ImpCol$keep
keep <- as.logical(keep)
playCallData <- relevantData[,keep]
```

### Additional Reclassing and readying data for Impution

Change field types to factor and replace values of 'Impute' with NA
```{r Additional Reclassing and readying data for Impution, cache = TRUE, dependson = "playCallData"}
##Reclass various fields as factor
playCallData$posteam <- as.factor(playCallData$posteam)
playCallData$DefensiveTeam <- as.factor(playCallData$DefensiveTeam)
playCallData$PlayType <- as.factor(playCallData$PlayType)
playCallData$PassLength <- as.factor(playCallData$PassLength)
playCallData$RunGap <- as.factor(playCallData$RunGap)
playCallData$HomeTeam <- as.factor(playCallData$HomeTeam)
playCallData$AwayTeam <- as.factor(playCallData$AwayTeam)

##Reclass values of 'Impute' to NA
RunGap <- playCallData$RunGap
RunGap[RunGap == 'Impute'] = NA
playCallData$RunGap = RunGap
PassLength <- playCallData$PassLength
PassLength[PassLength == 'Impute'] = NA
playCallData$PassLength <- PassLength
```

### Impute Values for RunGap and PassLength

1. Separate data into two separate datasets (one for run plays and one for pass plays), since Impution of RunGap values is dependent on different variables than PassLength values.
2. Impute individual RunGap and PassLength values
3. Incorporate imputed values into both individual run and pass datasets and combined dataset

```{r Impute Values for RunGap and PassLength, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide', dependson = "playCallData"}
##Separate playCallData into individual data sets for pass and run in order to impute values
playCallData$seq <- 1:nrow(playCallData)
seq <- playCallData$seq
playCallDataPass <- playCallData[playCallData$PlayType == 'Pass',]
playCallDataRun <- playCallData[playCallData$PlayType == 'Run',]

##Impute RunGap values and insert into Run Play data
RunGapImputionValues <- c('Drive', 'down', 'TimeSecs', 'yrdline100', 'ydstogo', 'RunGap', 'PosTeamScore', 'ScoreDiff', 'posteam_timeouts_pre', 'Season', 'Week', 'HomeTeamGamesWon', 'HomeVsAwayGamesWon', 'DivisionGame')
playCallDataRun <- playCallDataRun[,RunGapImputionValues]
amelia_fit <- amelia(playCallDataRun, m=1, parallel = "multicore", noms = "RunGap")
playCallDataRun$RunGap <- amelia_fit$imputations[[1]]$RunGap

##Impute assLength values and insert into Pass Play data
PassLengthImputionValues <- c('Drive', 'down', 'TimeSecs', 'yrdline100', 'ydstogo', 'PassLength', 'AirYards', 'QBHit', 'Sack', 'PosTeamScore', 'ScoreDiff', 'posteam_timeouts_pre', 'Season', 'Week', 'HomeTeamGamesWon', 'HomeVsAwayGamesWon', 'DivisionGame')
playCallDataPass <- playCallDataPass[,PassLengthImputionValues]
amelia_fit <- amelia(playCallDataPass, m=1, parallel = "multicore", noms = "PassLength")
playCallDataPass$PassLength <- amelia_fit$imputations[[1]]$PassLength

##Overwrite Missing Values into playCallData
playCallData[playCallData$PlayType =='Run',]$RunGap = playCallDataRun$RunGap
playCallData[playCallData$PlayType =='Pass',]$PassLength = playCallDataPass$PassLength
```

### Create alternate dependent variable and separate datasets for remaining preprocessing and modeling

* The original dependent variable is simply a run or a pass play.
* The alternate dependent variable breaks down pass plays into long or short, and breaks down run plays based on run gap (i.e. end, tackle, middle)
```{r create second dependent variable and separate datasets, cache = TRUE, dependson = 'playCallData'}
playCallData$PlayTypeDetail <- as.factor(paste(playCallData$PlayType,"-",playCallData$PassLength,"-",
                                               playCallData$RunGap))
BasicColumns <- c('Drive', 'down', 'TimeSecs', 'yrdline100', 'ydstogo', 'posteam', 'DefensiveTeam', 'PlayType',  'PosTeamScore', 'ScoreDiff', 'HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam', 'posteam_timeouts_pre', 'Season', 'Week', 'HomeTeamGamesWon', 'HomeVsAwayGamesWon', 'DivisionGame')
playCallDataBasic <- playCallData[,BasicColumns]
DetailColumns <- c('Drive', 'down', 'TimeSecs', 'yrdline100', 'ydstogo', 'posteam', 'DefensiveTeam', 'PosTeamScore', 'ScoreDiff', 'HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam', 'posteam_timeouts_pre', 'Season', 'Week', 'HomeTeamGamesWon', 'HomeVsAwayGamesWon', 'DivisionGame', 'PlayTypeDetail')
playCallDataDetail <- playCallData[,DetailColumns]
```

### Pre-Processing 

Pre-Processing must be done twice, once for the basic play type prediction model and once for the detail play type prediction model.  After pre-processing, the dependent variable(s) are then added back to each of the two data sets prior to data splitting and model evaluation 
```{r Pre-Processing, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
##Create Dummy Variables
dummiesBasic <- dummyVars(PlayType ~ ., data = playCallDataBasic)
predictorsBasicPlayType <- as.data.frame(predict(dummiesBasic, newdata = playCallDataBasic))
dummiesDetail <- dummyVars(PlayTypeDetail ~ ., data = playCallDataDetail)
predictorsDetailPlayType <- as.data.frame(predict(dummiesDetail, newdata = playCallDataDetail))

##Remove Near Zero Value Predictors
nzvBasic <- nearZeroVar(predictorsBasicPlayType)
predictorsBasicPlayTypeFiltered <- predictorsBasicPlayType[, -nzvBasic]
nzvDetail <- nearZeroVar(predictorsDetailPlayType)
predictorsDetailPlayTypeFiltered <- predictorsDetailPlayType[, -nzvDetail]

##Remove Highly Correlated Predictors
descrCorBasic <- cor(predictorsBasicPlayTypeFiltered)
highlyCorDescrBasic <- findCorrelation(descrCorBasic, cutoff = .75)
predictorsBasicPlayTypeFiltered2 <- predictorsBasicPlayTypeFiltered[,-highlyCorDescrBasic]
descrCorDetail <- cor(predictorsDetailPlayTypeFiltered)
highlyCorDescrDetail <- findCorrelation(descrCorDetail, cutoff = .75)
predictorsDetailPlayTypeFiltered2 <- predictorsDetailPlayTypeFiltered[,-highlyCorDescrDetail]

##Note no linear combinations to remove

##Add Dependent Variable to dataset prior to data splitting
predictorsBasicPlayTypeFiltered2$PlayType <- playCallDataBasic$PlayType
predictorsDetailPlayTypeFiltered2$PlayTypeDetail <- playCallDataDetail$PlayTypeDetail
```

### Partition into test and training sets

Note that centering and/or scaling the data did not make a meterial difference in model building.  Prediction models were built on data without centering and scaling and separately including centering and scaling. Since the models performed essentially the same with and without, centering and scaling data is omitted here.
```{r Partition into test and training sets, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(playCallData$PlayType, p = .8, list = F, times = 1)
trainingBasic <- predictorsBasicPlayTypeFiltered2[trainIndex,]
testBasic <- predictorsBasicPlayTypeFiltered2[-trainIndex,]
trainingDetail <- predictorsDetailPlayTypeFiltered2[trainIndex,]
testDetail <- predictorsDetailPlayTypeFiltered2[-trainIndex,]

##Note: Centering and Scaling the data did not make a material difference in optimizing model predictions and so was not used here
```

### Predictive Modeling

The process of determining the best predictive model started by using EXtreme Gradient Boosting (xgbTree), probably the methodology that has seen the best and highly publicized results over the last several years.

In order to determine optimum parameter values, an adaptive resampling process was implemented in conjunction with the `caret train` function 
```{r Predictive Modeling, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "adaptive_cv", 
                           number = 10, 
                           adaptive = list(min = 5, alpha = 0.05, 
                                           method = "gls", complete = TRUE),
                           search = 'random')
xgbFitBasic <- train(PlayType ~., data = trainingBasic, method = 'xgbTree', trControl = fitControl, tuneLength = 20)
## Note that I was only able to get the following model training to work when using parallel processing.  When using single core processing my R session aborted every time.
xgbFitDetail <- train(PlayTypeDetail ~., data = trainingDetail, method = 'xgbTree', trControl = fitControl, tuneLength = 20)
```

## Results

The basic (run or pass) prediction model yields strong results, with correct predictions 67-68% of the time vs a 56% no information rate.  
```{r Basic Results, cache = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
xgbPredBasic <- predict(xgbFitBasic, testBasic)
testBasicWithResults <- cbind(testBasic, xgbPredBasic)
confusionMatrix(xgbPredBasic, reference = testBasic$PlayType)
##Basic Prediction Accuracy by Down
BasicPlayCallFirstDown <- (table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[1,1,1]+table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[2,2,1]) / dim(testBasicWithResults[testBasicWithResults$down ==1,])[1]
NoInformationFirstDown <- (table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[1,2,1]+table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[2,2,1]) / dim(testBasicWithResults[testBasicWithResults$down ==1,])[1]
BasicPlayCallSecondDown <- (table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[1,1,2]+table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[2,2,2]) / dim(testBasicWithResults[testBasicWithResults$down ==2,])[1]
NoInformationSecondDown <- (table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[1,1,2]+table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[2,1,2]) / dim(testBasicWithResults[testBasicWithResults$down ==2,])[1]
BasicPlayCallThirdDown <- (table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[1,1,3]+table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[2,2,3]) / dim(testBasicWithResults[testBasicWithResults$down ==3,])[1]
NoInformationThirdDown <- (table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[1,1,3]+table(testBasicWithResults$xgbPredBasic, testBasicWithResults$PlayType, testBasicWithResults$down)[2,1,3]) / dim(testBasicWithResults[testBasicWithResults$down ==3,])[1]
BasicPlayCallByDown <- c(BasicPlayCallFirstDown, BasicPlayCallSecondDown, BasicPlayCallThirdDown)
NoInformation <- data.frame(Down = c('First', 'Second', 'Third'), Type = 'NoInformation', Rate = c(NoInformationFirstDown, NoInformationSecondDown, NoInformationThirdDown))
Predicted <- data.frame(Down = c('First', 'Second', 'Third'), Type = 'Predicted', Rate = c(BasicPlayCallFirstDown, BasicPlayCallSecondDown, BasicPlayCallThirdDown))
Comparison <- rbind(NoInformation, Predicted)
ggplot(Comparison, aes(x = Down, y = Rate, fill = Type)) + geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + ggtitle('Correct Prediction Rate vs No Information Rate') + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = 'bold')) + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

The detail model prediction results are not as strong as expected due to the fact that almost all (99%+) play predicted as a pass are predicted to be a short (<=15 yards) pass.  In order to change the predictions to include a greater percentage of pass plays to be long passes, the model would need to use a different metric and/or include a penalty for wrong predictions (not done here).

```{r Detail Results, cache = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
xgbPredDetail <- predict(xgbFitDetail, testDetail)
testDetailWithResults <- cbind(testDetail, xgbPredDetail)
confusionMatrix(xgbPredDetail, reference = testDetail$PlayTypeDetail)
```
```
